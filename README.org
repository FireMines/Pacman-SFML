#+TITLE: Evaluation Assignment 2


This is a good work. Is has all the features required and it is efficient on
rendering. I appreciate very much that you have tried to introduce geometry
shaders. As I mentioned to you, it did not work on my machine, but I could see
it works on yours. My only minor comment is that the design could be improved:
there is still a significant amount of code structured in just your =main.cpp=
file that could have been structured in classes. You have a segmentation fault
due to calling OpenGL functions after =glfwTerminate()=. You also have memory
leaks e.g., here you allocate =tileVAO = new VAO();= but never delete.

My evaluation of this work is: **A**
