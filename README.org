#+TITLE: Group 17: Assignment 1: Pacman.

Members: Lars Blütecher Holter, Lillian Alice Wangerud, Matthias David Greeven

* Introduction

	We made Pacman with openGL. 

	You move the character around with your arrow keys when you've launched the program
	(Up, Down, Left and Right).

	The game will end when you collect all the pellets, and all the sprites on screen will stop.

	How to run the program:
	Clone the repository from Github.
	Generate the CMake list when the files have finished loading in.

	(Should the program fail to load / Cmake list fail to generate, try the following command in
	your GIT command line:
	$ git submodule update --init --recursive
	)
	
	Launch the program via the Pacman.exe file, and enjoy :)
